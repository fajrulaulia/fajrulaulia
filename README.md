## Hi there 👋🏻

I'm Software Engineer currently work in Jakarta, Indonesia. I write code to solve problem, write test code before build, adapt to the new environment and culture by studying and discussing. by the way I like coffee <img class="emoji" alt="coffee" height="20" width="20" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2615.png"> and stay in coffee shop for few hour.
